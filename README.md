## Test Your Laravel Routing Skills

This repository is a test for you: fill in `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php` which are left intentionally empty.

You will find comments describing 12 tasks in those two files. For the majority of the tasks, you need to write only ONE line of code.

For example:

```
// Task 2: point the GET URL "/user/[name]" to the UserController method "show"
// It doesn't use Route Model Binding, it expects $name as a parameter
// Put one code line here below
```

To test whether all of the routes are working correctly, there are PHPUnit tests in the `tests/Feature/RoutesTest.php` file.

When you first run `php artisan test`, or `vendor/bin/phpunit`, all 8 tests fail.
Your task is to make those tests pass.

## How to Submit Your Solution

If you want to submit your solution, then you should make a Pull Request to the `main` branch.
It will automatically run the tests via Github Actions and will show you/me whether the test passes.

If you don't know how to make a Pull Request, [here's my video with instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEcT6JIFji0).

This task is mostly do-it-yourself, so I'm not planning to review or merge the Pull Requests. This test is for you to assess your own skills. The automated tests will be your answer if you passed the test :)

## Questions / Problems?

If you are struggling with some of the tasks, or if you have suggestions how to improve the task, then please create a Github Issue.

Good luck!
